## **PocketPilot: AI-Powered Personal Finance Management (MVP Blueprint)**

**1. Project Vision:**
To empower individuals with an intelligent and intuitive personal finance management platform that leverages AI to automate financial tracking, provide actionable insights, personalized budgeting advice, and streamline progress towards financial goals, ultimately making financial wellness accessible and effortless.

**2. MVP Objective:**
Deliver a robust and functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) showcasing the core value proposition of AI-driven financial assistance. This MVP will serve as a compelling demonstration for our Fiverr gig and a stable foundation for future feature expansion. Focus is on **functionality**, not perfection.

**3. Core Features (MVP Focus):**
*   **Secure User Authentication:** Standard signup, login, and session management.
*   **Bank Account Connectivity:** Seamless and secure integration with Plaid API to fetch transaction data.
*   **Automated Expense Categorization:** (AI-Powered) Transactions fetched from linked accounts will be automatically classified into common financial categories using a trained ML model.
*   **Spending Overview & Basic Budgeting:**
    *   Display of categorized spending.
    *   Simple visualization of spending against user-defined monthly budgets for key categories.
*   **Basic Financial Goal Tracking:** Allow users to set simple, numeric financial goals (e.g., "Save $1000 by X date") and manually track progress.

**4. Technical Stack:**
*   **Frontend:** React.js (for web dashboard MVP)
*   **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js
*   **AI/ML:** Python (Scikit-learn for expense categorization model)
*   **Data Integration:** Plaid API
*   **Version Control:** Git / GitHub
*   **Development Environment:** GitHub Codespaces
*   **Deployment Target (Initial):** Netlify for Frontend, or a simple cloud provider for Backend if necessary.

**5. Development Methodology:**
*   **AI-Assisted Development:** Leverage Roo Code and similar AI tools extensively for code generation, pattern identification, refactoring, and unit testing.
*   **Agile & Iterative:** Prioritize features for the MVP. Develop in short sprints, focusing on one core functionality at a time.
*   **"Get It Done" Principle:** Aim for working features over extensive polish in the MVP. Minor UI imperfections are acceptable if core functionality is sound.
*   **Context Engineering:** Ensure detailed, precise prompts to the AI for optimal code output.

**6. Phased Implementation Plan (MVP Milestones):**

*   **Phase 1: Foundation & Connectivity (Estimated 1-2 Weeks)**
    *   **Task 1:** Project structure initialization (React app, Node.js backend).
    *   **Task 2:** Implement robust User Authentication (e.g., JWT-based).
    *   **Task 3:** Plaid Integration: Set up client-side token exchange and server-side item/transaction retrieval, including basic webhook handling for new transactions.
    *   **Task 4:** Database setup (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB) for users and raw transaction data.

*   **Phase 2: AI Categorization & Spending Analysis (Estimated 2-3 Weeks)**
    *   **Task 5:** **AI Model Development:** Train a Scikit-learn model for expense categorization using a sample dataset. (Roo Code crucial here for training and integrating the model via an API).
    *   **Task 6:** Backend API to process transactions, call the ML model, and store categorized data.
    *   **Task 7:** Frontend dashboard to fetch and display categorized transactions.
    *   **Task 8:** Implement basic charts (e.g., pie chart or bar chart) to visualize spending by category.

*   **Phase 3: Budgeting & Goal Tracking (MVP) (Estimated 1-2 Weeks)**
    *   **Task 9:** Implement manual budget setting for categories.
    *   **Task 10:** Display user spending vs. budget for selected categories.
    *   **Task 11:** Develop functionality for basic goal setting and manual progress logging.

*   **Phase 4: MVP Polish & Preparation (Estimated 1 Week)**
    *   **Task 12:** Basic UI refinement for core features to ensure clarity.
    *   **Task 13:** Implement basic error handling and user feedback.
    *   **Task 14:** Prepare for initial deployment on Netlify/host.
    *   **Task 15:** Create introductory demo flow documentation.

**7. Collaboration Strategy:**
*   **Branching:** Every new feature/task starts with `git checkout -b feature/<task-name>`.
*   **Committing:** Frequent, descriptive commits.
*   **Pushing:** Regular pushes to remote feature branches (`git push origin feature/<task-name>`).
*   **Pull Requests (PRs):** All merges to `main` must go through a PR for review.
